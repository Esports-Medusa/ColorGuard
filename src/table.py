        "Collect users' public posts, comments, earlier performance, and reports from other users to gather behavioral data.",
        "Evaluate for bullying language, inappropriate posts, and past flagged behaviors.",
        "Analyze text content to detect harmful language and behaviors using NLP tools.",
        "Provide a score (0-100) reflecting the user's behavior quality, based on NLP analysis and other inputs.",
        "Assign colors to scores: Red for aggressive/inappropriate behavior, Green for safe and appropriate behavior.",
        "Marks and color codes are visible only to minors to guide their interaction decisions.",
        "Alerts minors about potentially harmful interactions, enabling them to avoid engaging with flagged users."

    "Technical Considerations": [
        "Ensure user consent for data collection, anonymization, and legal compliance with data privacy laws.",
        "Develop clear and unbiased criteria for evaluating harmful behaviors.",
        "Utilize advanced NLP models like Detoxify or ToxiCraft to ensure robust detection.",
        "Implement scalable scoring logic and real-time updates for dynamic behavioral changes.",
        "Ensure accurate and non-biased color assignment for behavior ratings.",
        "Prevent misuse or overexposure of marks, maintaining user trust and ethical handling.",
        "Develop safeguards against false positives/negatives and provide user appeal mechanisms."
    ],
    "Ethical Considerations": [
        "Respect users' privacy and only use publicly available information.",
        "Avoid over-penalizing borderline cases and provide clear feedback on assessments.",
        "Ensure fairness in NLP model training and prevent biases in detection algorithms.",
        "Avoid stigmatization of users with low scores; promote improvement instead.",
        "Communicate transparently about how scores and colors are determined.",
        "Protect minors' sensitive data and identities while displaying adult behavior ratings.",
        "Promote education on cyber safety and respectful communication."
